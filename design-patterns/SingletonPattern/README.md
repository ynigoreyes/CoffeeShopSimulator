<h1>Singleton Pattern</h1>
Singleton Pattern is a simple design pattern, This type of pattern uses a single class that is responsible to creaate an object and make sure that only a signle object is created, as well as a way to access the object it created. 

For example, in our project we used a class called CoffeeShopEventBus, creating the CoffeeShopEventBus object. The static instance of CoffeeShopEventBus then gets sent to the CoffeeShop class where it will be used.
