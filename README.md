#### Project Goal
Through the use of various use cases, we plan to implement a simulated coffee shop using Java that allows for a number of customers to enter the coffee shop and place an order with the barista currently working. After taking the order from the customer, the Barista will make the items the customer orders, then serve the ordered items to the customer by calling out their name. The manager will overlook the coffee shop by occasionally changing the items that can be ordered off the menu, and will keep track of the number of hours the barista has worked so that they may pay them accordingly.

#### Use Cases

* __Ordering Products__
Given that the customer has money to buy something from the menu, the customer will tell the barista what they want from the menu. The barista then charges the customer by asking for a card and swiping it on the register. Once complete, the customer will wait for the order to complete.


* __Picking Up Orders__
Given that the customer has a pending order and the barista has properly processed the payment, the customer will wait for their name to be called, signalling their order is ready to get picked up. The customer will then pick up their order and the order is complete.
