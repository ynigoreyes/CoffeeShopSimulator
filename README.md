#### Use Cases

* __Ordering Products__
Given that the customer has money to buy something from the menu, the customer will tell the barista what they want from the menu. The barista then charges the customer by asking for a card and swiping it on the register. Once complete, the customer will wait for the order to complete.


* __Picking Up Orders__
Given that the customer has a pending order and the barista has properly processed the payment, the customer will wait for their name to be called, signalling their order is ready to get picked up. The customer will then pick up their order and the order is complete.

* __Serve__
Given the customers orders have been completed in full by the barista, the barista will gather all items in a customers order and check the name on the order. After doing so the barista will call out the customers name to signal that their order is completed and ready to be picked up.
