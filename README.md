#### Use Cases

* __Ordering Products__

Given that the customer has money to buy something from the menu, the customer will tell the barista what they want from the menu. The barista then charges the customer by asking for a card and swiping it on the register. Once complete, the customer will wait for the order to complete.

* __Picking Up Orders__

Given that the customer has a pending order and the barista has properly processed the payment, the customer will wait for their name to be called, signalling their order is ready to get picked up. The customer will then pick up their order and the order is complete.
